<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Between 00:00 UTC on 01 October 2024 and 06:01 UTC on 10 October 2024, you were identified as a customer using saved charts or the Insights blade for storage account (non-classic) metrics in Azure Monitor, who may have been unable to load certain charts or insights referring to specific storage metrics namespaces (blob, file, queues, table). If you were using the Metrics blade, you may not be able to see the namespaces until you select the specific storage sub-resource (blob, file, queue, table) corresponding to these metric namespaces. This impacts only non-classic storage accounts and does not affect account-level metrics or other resource types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do we know so far?</strong></p>
<p>We determined that this issue was caused due to a code regression in the Azure Metrics chart control resulting in failures for these specifics type of Storage metrics when queried from the Azure Portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did we respond?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Previously by 16:46 UTC on 26 September 2024 - Rollout of the regression started.</li><li>00:00 UTC on 01 October 2024 - Customer impact began.&nbsp;</li><li>00:05 UTC on 01 October 2024 - Our internal service monitoring detected failure rates going above the defined thresholds, and we started collaborating with additional teams to devise a mitigation solution and to find a root cause.</li><li>Approximately by 18:00 UTC on 08 October 2024 - The contributing factors of this issue were identified to be a code regression, and we started to identify and start deploying the hotfix to the regions affected by this outage. There were multiple regions affected globally, and this took us some time. Initially, this started with an investigation of another issue caused by the change of code regression post which we associated that root cause to this issue.</li><li>Furthermore, after recognizing the root cause, approximately by 20:00 UTC on 08 October 2024- Mitigation workstream started by applying a hotfix to all the regions globally. To all the regions, the deployment was successfully deployed except France Central.</li><li>05:10 UTC on 10 October 2024 ΓÇô The failing region was excluded from serving traffic to ensure the fix was provided to all users.</li><li>05:55 UTC on 10 October 2024- We concluded that service operations were restored upon the next refresh of the portal.</li><li>06:01 UTC on 10 October 2024- The issue was declared mitigated after further monitoring, and full-service functionality was restored.</li></ul>

<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p></p><ul><li>Our team will be completing an internal retrospective to understand the incident in more detail. Once that is completed, generally within 14 days, we will publish a Post Incident Review (PIR) to all impacted customers.</li><li>To get notified when that happens, and/or to stay informed about future Azure service issues, make sure that you configure and maintain Azure Service Health alerts ΓÇô these can trigger emails, SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more:&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/ash-alerts" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/ash-alerts</a>.</li><li>For more information on Post Incident Reviews, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/AzurePIRs" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/AzurePIRs</a>.</li><li>The impact times above represent the full incident duration, so are not specific to any individual customer. Actual impact to service availability may vary between customers and resources ΓÇô for guidance on implementing monitoring to understand granular impact:&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/AzPIR/Monitoring" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/AzPIR/Monitoring</a></li><li>Finally, for broader guidance on preparing for cloud incidents, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/incidentreadiness" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/incidentreadiness</a>.</li></ul><p><br></p><p></p>
