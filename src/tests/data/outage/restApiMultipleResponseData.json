If you were using the Metrics blade, you may not be able to see the namespaces until you select the specific storage sub-resource (blob, file, queue, table) corresponding to these metric namespaces.

There were multiple regions affected globally, and this took us some time. Initially, this started with an investigation of another issue caused by the change of code regression post which we associated that root cause to this issue.</li><li>Furthermore, after recognizing the root cause, approximately by 20:00 UTC on 08 October 2024- Mitigation workstream started by applying a hotfix to all the regions globally. To all the regions, the deployment was successfully deployed except France Central.</li><li>05:10 UTC on 10 October 2024 – The failing region was excluded from serving traffic to ensure the fix was provided to all users.</li><li>05:55 UTC on 10 October 2024- We concluded that service operations were restored upon the next refresh of the portal.</li><li>06:01 UTC on 10 October 2024- The issue was declared mitigated after further monitoring, and full-service functionality was restored.</li></ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Our team will be completing an internal retrospective to understand the incident in more detail. Once that is completed, generally within 14 days, we will publish a Post Incident Review (PIR) to all impacted customers.</li><li>To get notified when that happens, and/or to stay informed about future Azure service issues, make sure that you configure and maintain Azure Service Health alerts – these can trigger emails, SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/ash-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/ash-alerts</a>.</li><li>For more information on Post Incident Reviews, refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzurePIRs\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/AzurePIRs</a>.</li><li>The impact times above represent the full incident duration, so are not specific to any individual customer.
