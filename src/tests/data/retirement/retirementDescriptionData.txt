<p><em>You're receiving this notice because you're an Azure customer.</em></p>
<p>To enhance security and provide best-in-class encryption for your data,&nbsp;<strong>we'll require interactions with Azure services to be secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later beginning 31 October 2024</strong>, when support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 will end.</p>
<p>The Microsoft implementation of older TLS versions is not known to be vulnerable, however, TLS 1.2 and later offer improved security with features such as perfect forward secrecy and stronger cipher suites.</p>
<h2>Recommended action</h2>
<p>To avoid potential service disruptions,&nbsp;<strong>confirm that&nbsp;your resources that interact with Azure services are using TLS 1.2 or later</strong>. Then:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>If they're already exclusively using TLS 1.2 or later, you don't need to take further action.</li><li>If they still have a dependency on TLS 1.0 or 1.1,&nbsp;<strong>transition&nbsp;them to TLS 1.2 or later by 31 October 2024</strong>.</li></ul><h2>Help and support</h2><p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/RemoveLegacyTLS" target="_blank">update to TLS 1.2</a>.
