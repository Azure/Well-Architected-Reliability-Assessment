It achieved this by automatically onboarding Virtual Machines (VMs) to services like Azure Monitor, Backup, and Microsoft Defender, and continuously monitoring and correcting configuration drift to ensure compliance.</p>\n<p>All Automanage Best Practices features and much more are already available in Azure Policy today. As such,&nbsp;<strong>we encourage you to transition to Azure Policy prior to 30 September 2027</strong>&nbsp;to experience the new capabilities of Azure Policy including:</p>\n<ul><li>Enforced compliance across a wider range of resources and services, not just virtual machines.</li><li>Greater flexibility in creating and applying custom policies tailored to specific scenarios.</li><li>Consolidated reporting of resource compliance in large-scale environments with multiple subscriptions and resource groups.</li><li>Better integration with other Azure governance and management product, providing a more seamless resource management experience.</li><li>In-depth compliance reports and dashboards, making it easier to track and manage compliance</li></ul>\n<p>As you migrate, it’s worthwhile to note that Automanage Best Practices is a cost-free service. As such, you will not receive a bill from the Automanage service. However, if you used Automanage to enable paid services like Azure Insights, there may be usage charges incurred that are billed directly by those services. Read more about Automanage and pricing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-automanage/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>From now to&nbsp;<strong>30 September 2027</strong>, you can continue to use Automanage Best Practices without disruption.
