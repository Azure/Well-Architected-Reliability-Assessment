It achieved this by automatically onboarding Virtual Machines (VMs) to services like Azure Monitor, Backup, and Microsoft Defender, and continuously monitoring and correcting configuration drift to ensure compliance.</p>\n<p>All Automanage Best Practices features and much more are already available in Azure Policy today. As such,&nbsp;<strong>we encourage you to transition to Azure Policy prior to 30 September 2027</strong>&nbsp;to experience the new capabilities of Azure Policy including:</p>\n<ul><li>Enforced compliance across a wider range of resources and services, not just virtual machines.</li><li>Greater flexibility in creating and applying custom policies tailored to specific scenarios.</li><li>Consolidated reporting of resource compliance in large-scale environments with multiple subscriptions and resource groups.</li><li>Better integration with other Azure governance and management product, providing a more seamless resource management experience.</li><li>In-depth compliance reports and dashboards, making it easier to track and manage compliance</li></ul>\n<p>As you migrate, it’s worthwhile to note that Automanage Best Practices is a cost-free service. As such, you will not receive a bill from the Automanage service. However, if you used Automanage to enable paid services like Azure Insights, there may be usage charges incurred that are billed directly by those services.
