# Well-Architected-Reliability-Assessment
The Well-Architected Reliability Assessment is aimed to assess an Azure workload implementation across the reliability pillar of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. A workload is a resource or collection of resources that provide end-to-end functionality to one or multiple clients (humans or systems). An application can have multiple workloads, with multiple APIs and databases working together to deliver specific functionality.

The main goal of the Well-Architected Reliability Assessment is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive end-to-end Architecture and Resources review of an existing Workload to identify critical reliability, resiliency, availability, and recovery risks to the scoped workload on Azure.

This repository holds scripts and automation built for the Well-Architected Reliability Assessment and is currently under development.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Install the WARA module from the PowerShell Gallery.
2. Import the WARA module.
3. Start the WARA collector.

These instructions are the same for any platform that supports PowerShell. The following instructions have been tested on Azure Cloud Shell, Windows, and Linux.
```powershell
# Installs the WARA module from the PowerShell Gallery.
Install-Module WARA

# Import the WARA module.
Import-Module WARA

# Start the WARA collector.
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```



### Example Usage

You can review all of the parameters on the Start-WARACollector [here](docs/wara/Start-WARACollector.md).

#### Run the collector against a specific subscription.
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

#### Run the collector against a multiple specific subscriptions.
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds @("/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","/subscriptions/)00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001")
```

#### Run the collector against a specific subscription and resource group.
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -ResourceGroups "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RG-001"
```

#### Run the collector against a specific subscription and resource group and filtering by tag key/values.
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -ResourceGroups "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RG-001" -Tags "Env||Environment!~Dev||QA" -AVD -SAP -HPC
```

#### Run the collector against a specific subscription and resource group, filtering by tag key/values and using the specialized resource types (AVD, SAP, HPC, AVS).
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -TenantID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -SubscriptionIds "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -ResourceGroups "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RG-001" -Tags "Env||Environment!~Dev||QA" -AVD -SAP -HPC
```

#### Run the collector using a configuration file.
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -ConfigFile "C:\path\to\config.txt"
```

#### Run the collector using a configuration file and using the specialized resource types (AVD, SAP, HPC, AVS).
```PowerShell
Start-WARACollector -ConfigFile "C:\path\to\config.txt" -SAP -AVD
```

## Project Structure
This repository is meant to be used for the development of the Well-Architected Reliability Assessment automation. This project uses outputs from the Azure Well-Architected Framework and Azure Advisor to provide insights into the reliability of an Azure workload.
