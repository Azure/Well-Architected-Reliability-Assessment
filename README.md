# Well-Architected-Reliability-Assessment
The Well-Architected Reliability Assessment is aimed to assess an Azure workload implementation across the reliability pillar of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. A workload is a resource or collection of resources that provide end-to-end functionality to one or multiple clients (humans or systems). An application can have multiple workloads, with multiple APIs and databases working together to deliver specific functionality.

The main goal of the Well-Architected Reliability Assessment is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive end-to-end Architecture and Resources review of an existing Workload to identify critical reliability, resiliency, availability, and recovery risks to the scoped workload on Azure.

This repository holds scripts and automation built for the Well-Architected Reliability Assessment and is currently under development.
